# GainzTracker
This SwiftUI Project is an app that allows users to be able to easily track their weights for different gyms that they use. This is my first big SwiftUI project and it taught me many necessary core concepts such as SwiftData, NavigationLinks, and Dictionarys. Using SwiftData I was able to store the users data right inside the app so that they never have to worry about losing the data they store in the App. This app is for all gym users new and old and the interface makes it very easy to learn how to add your workouts to the gym of their choice. Overall I am very happy with how the app turned out and I am excited to create more amazing apps using Xcode and SwiftUI.

Bellow are Photos of the App in Action!
